## Introduction
`js-line-highlight` is Javascript text, paragraph line highlighter. 
Enables you to give your visitors better reading experience of your content. 
On element where initialized it will track user mouse movements and automatically 
highlight text he is currently reading.

I've only tested it in latest Firefox, chrome/ium and opera.
